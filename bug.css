The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.container div {
  color: red;
}

#specific-div {
  color: green;
}

#specific-div.container {
  color: purple; /* This will override the style */
}

```

The unexpected behavior arises from the specificity of the selector `#specific-div.container`.  While seemingly simple, this selector has higher specificity than `#specific-div` because of the combined ID and class selectors.
